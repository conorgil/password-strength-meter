# password-strength-meter
Ideas, notes, and brainstorms for creating a password strength meter that takes into account human behavior and other heuristics to do a better job of identifying weak passwords.

# Ideas
* only warn when a password is **known** to be weak?
* figure out some other way to communicate "as best we can tell, that password isn't garbage. It might still suck though"
* Integrate Pwned Passwords V2 API. It is really fast, so this shouldn't be a problem
* Allow configuration of some other heuristics, such as the name of the service, the user's name, etc. The password can be checked for permutations of all of these
* Need a good UI that doesn't block as all of this stuff is checked. Maybe it is too computationally intensive and should be done on the server side?
